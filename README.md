## Welcome to CSU Games

## Game Making Education at CSU East Bay
Game Design applies this to entertainment, both experimental and commercial.
Students analyze interactivity in art, design, and everyday life, acquire
skills and develop prototypes, and work in collaborative teams to
produce successful games and creatively solve real-world problems.
